IAM Users and Groups Lab Practice

In this lab, the objective was to explore how IAM users inherit permissions through IAM groups.

I created three IAM users:

User1

User2

User3

I also created three IAM groups, each with specific permissions:

S3Support – Read-only access to Amazon S3

EC2Support – Read-only access to Amazon EC2

EC2Admin – Permission to view, start, and stop EC2 instances

At the start of the lab, none of the users were assigned to any group, meaning they had no permissions due to IAM’s implicit deny behavior.

I then assigned users to groups as follows:

User1 → S3Support

User2 → EC2Support

User3 → EC2Admin

After assigning the users to their respective groups, I tested the permissions by signing in as each user using the IAM user sign-in URL, which I accessed from the Security Credentials section.

This confirmed that each user only had the permissions associated with the group they were assigned to, demonstrating the principle of least privilege and how IAM group-based access control works in practice.
