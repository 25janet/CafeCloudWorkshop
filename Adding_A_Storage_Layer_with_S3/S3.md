# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## Overview

Amazon S3 is an **object storage service** that stores data as **objects** within **buckets**. Each bucket acts as a container for objects, and each object represents a file along with its associated metadata.

* Objects are stored inside buckets
* Each object can be up to **5 TB** in size
* Every object has a **unique URL** and exists within a **global namespace** (bucket names must be unique across AWS)

### Object Components

Each S3 object consists of:

* **Object key** – the unique identifier (file name/path) for the object within a bucket
* **Version ID** – used when versioning is enabled to track different versions of the same object
* **Value** – the actual data/content of the object
* **Metadata** – key-value pairs that describe the object (system-defined or user-defined)
* **Subresources** – additional information associated with an object, such as ACLs, tags, and torrent data

## S3 Use Cases

Amazon S3 is designed for durability, scalability, and availability, making it suitable for many workloads, including:

* **Media hosting** (images, videos, audio files)
* **Static website hosting** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* **Data storage for computation and analytics** (big data, machine learning, data lakes)
* **Backup and archival of data** (disaster recovery, long-term storage)

## Data Transfer Methods in S3

Data can be moved into and out of Amazon S3 using several mechanisms:

### Multipart Upload

Multipart upload allows large files to be broken into smaller parts and uploaded in parallel.

* Improves upload performance
* Supports pausing and resuming uploads
* Recommended for large files

### Object Upload

Standard object upload is used for smaller files where multipart upload is not required.

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration enables **fast, secure file transfers over long distances** by using **Amazon CloudFront edge locations**. Data is routed through AWS’s optimized global network to reach S3 more quickly.

### AWS Transfer Family

AWS Transfer Family provides **fully managed file transfer services** that allow data to be transferred into S3 (and EFS) using familiar protocols:

* **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**
* **FTP**
* **FTPS**

## Storage Management Concepts in S3

### Lifecycle Policies

Lifecycle policies allow you to **automatically manage objects over time** by defining rules that transition objects between storage classes or expire them.

Examples include:

* Moving objects to cheaper storage classes (e.g., S3 Glacier) after a certain number of days
* Deleting objects automatically after they are no longer needed

Lifecycle policies help optimize **cost**, **performance**, and **data retention**.

### S3 Versioning

S3 Versioning allows multiple versions of the same object to be stored in a bucket.

Benefits include:

* Protection against accidental deletion or overwrites
* Ability to restore previous versions of objects
* Improved data integrity and recovery

When versioning is enabled, each object modification results in a new **version ID**.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Amazon S3 supports **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, which is configured using an **XML file**.

CORS allows a **web application running in one domain** to interact with resources stored in **a different domain** (such as an S3 bucket).

This is commonly required when:

* A frontend application hosted elsewhere needs to access S3 objects
* Browser-based requests are made across different origins

CORS rules define:

* Allowed origins
* Allowed HTTP methods
* Allowed headers
* Exposed headers

---

## Summary

Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that supports a wide range of use cases, from static website hosting to data analytics and long-term archival. Through features like multipart uploads, lifecycle policies, versioning, and CORS, S3 provides flexibility, security, and cost optimization for modern cloud applications.
