Steps Followed
1. Create an S3 Bucket

    I created an Amazon S3 bucket to host the static website

    The bucket name was globally unique

2. Disable Block Public Access

    I disabled Block all public access to allow the bucket to be publicly accessible

    This is required for static website hosting

3. Enable ACLs and Static Website Hosting

    I enabled ACLs on the bucket

    I enabled Static website hosting

    I specified index.html as the index document

4. Upload Website Content

    I uploaded the static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to the S3 bucket

5. Create a Bucket Policy (Read-Only Access)

    I created a bucket policy to grant public read-only (s3:GetObject) permissions

    This allows users to access the website content through the S3 website endpoint

    The bucket policy used:
                {
                    "Version": "2012-10-17",
                    "Statement": [
                        {
                        "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": "*",
                        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-aws-alx-demo-123/*"
                        }
                    ]
                    }


6. Enable Bucket Versioning

    I enabled S3 Versioning on the bucket

    This allows multiple versions of objects to be stored and helps with recovery from accidental deletions or overwrites

7. Configure Lifecycle Policies

    I created two lifecycle policies to manage storage cost and data retention:

    Transition lifecycle policy

        Transitions objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days

    Expiration lifecycle policy

        Expires (deletes) objects after 365 days

Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

    To improve durability and disaster recovery, I configured Cross-Region Replication (CRR):

    I created a second S3 bucket in a different AWS region

    I enabled versioning on the destination bucket

    In the source bucket, I enabled CRR to replicate the entire bucket to the destination bucket

    I used the AWS-managed IAM role (Cafe role) to allow S3 to replicate objects

CRR ensures that objects are automatically copied to another region for redundancy and availability.

Additional S3 Features
Object Lock

    Object Lock prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed retention period

    Useful for compliance and data protection use cases

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

    CORS allows a web application hosted in one domain to access S3 resources in another domain

    Configured using an XML-based CORS configuration

    Commonly required for frontend applications that interact with S3 buckets
