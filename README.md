# My-19-day-Challenge-for-aws-Solutions-architect
This repository documents my 19-day journey of revisiting, understanding, and evaluating core AWS concepts relevant to the AWS Solutions Architect role.

The purpose of this journey is to strengthen my foundational knowledge by revising everything I previously learned and applying it through real-world, hands-on scenarios. Rather than rushing into large projects, I am intentionally focusing on deep comprehension, best practices, and practical implementation.

This structured revision will help me:

Reinforce key AWS services and architectural principles

Practice secure, scalable, and cost-efficient designs

Identify knowledge gaps and strengthen weak areas

Build confidence before moving on to larger, more complex cloud projects

By the end of these 19 days, this repository will reflect my growth, learning process, and readiness to explore advanced architectures and future cloud engineering challenges.
